# lib\_multigame for Minetest

Note: Please consider this project abandoned. I have found an equivalent that
has actually had some progress, SFENCE's adaptation modpack:

[adapation_modpack](https://github.com/sfence/adaptation_modpack)

A library which aims to provide support for mods to run on multiple games for
the Minetest Engine. Currently planned is support for Minetest Game, MineClone2
and Hades Revisited for a start.
